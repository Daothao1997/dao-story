Once upon a time there was a guy named Doodoo. He lived in a small town call KM52. He was known for being the best volleyball player.  

Doodoo had a volleyball game today. He was super nervous and went to McDonalds right before his game. He got a Big Mac, fries, and shamrock shake.

Doodoo walked on to the field, and he didn't feel so great. Maybe the McDonald's wasn't the best idea before the big game. He thought he would be ok, but as he warmed up, he felt sicker and sicker.

Finally, the whole team lost because of Doodoo. On the way home, Doodoo was so sad that he decided to not eat McDonalds forever. Burger King seems a decent choice as a replacement.
